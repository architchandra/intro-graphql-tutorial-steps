A respository to accompany the [introductory GraphQL course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5199E50O7SI) by Net Ninja. This is not the [repository mentioned in the video](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/graphql-crash-course) but one created by me to quickly recollect what I had learned.

To run:
- Use Node 18 by running `nvm use` (requires nvm).
- Install depdencies using `npm ci`.
- Run `nodemon index`.
- Open the Apollo Sandbox at http://localhost:4000/.
